- Code comments: English for technical implementation, Japanese for user workflow comments
```

### Medium-term Improvements (Next Sprint)

#### 3. Complete RDRA Phase 1 Documentation
```markdown
**Action**: Create explicit requirements model document
**Content**: Extract and formalize the requirements model from business_value_definition.md and context_diagram.md
