' ポート・アダプターパターン
note right of Services
  **API境界仕様**
  - Protocol: Direct function calls
  - Data Format: Rust structs (serde)
  - Error Handling: Result<T, ServiceError>
  - Concurrency: Arc<RwLock<T>>
end note

note left of Domain
  **Domain Independence**
  - No external dependencies
  - Pure business logic
  - Technology agnostic
end note

' 品質属性
note bottom of APIClients
  **Quality Attributes:**
  - Rate Limiting: 10 req/sec
  - Retry Strategy: Exponential backoff
  - Circuit Breaker: Fail fast
  - Timeout: 30s per request
end note

note bottom of Storage
  **Quality Attributes:**
  - Encryption: AES-256-GCM
  - Atomic Operations: TOML transactions
  - Backup: Config versioning
  - Performance: Lazy loading
end note
